<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Welcome! This is a CRUD project (Create, Read, Update, Delete) made with Node.js for the backend structure, React.js for the frontend structure and PostgreSQL as database. Here you'll be able to see a platform where you can login, register users, see a list of users that's already been registered, edit and also delete them. However, to do so, you must be registered as an admin. Otherwise, you'll only be able to see the list of users.

There's also some extra tools:

  - It has an authentication method utilizing JWT token;
  - The project is containerized, so you can use Docker and docker-compose to build it up;
  - There are some automation tests using Jest. It needs to be improved, but you can see it working.

Now that you got the project open, there's a few things to do so we can proceed. I thought it would be better didaticaly for your understanding to make these steps separatedely, but wait up! Not in your computer, only for this document.

To go deeper in the project and know more details about how to run it, configure it and understand it better, you can see the README.MD inside of their own respective folders (backend and frontend), here in my GitHub. I describe it better there, in order to help you, so you can learn how to run each structure. I advise that you go first to the backend folder and after to the frontend.
